# Commands Structure After Optimization

## Main Developer Interface: Makefile

```bash
# Tool installation
make install-tools

# Dependency management  
make deps
make deps-clean

# Code quality
make lint
make lint-fix
make fmt
make pre-commit

# Testing
make test
make check

# Build and run
make build
make start
make stop

# Help
make help
```

## Remaining Scripts and Their Purpose:

### For Automation and CI/CD:
- **`build.sh`** - Docker build, used in documentation
- **`start.sh`** - Docker compose up, used in documentation  
- **`stop.sh`** - Docker compose down
- **`setup.sh`** - Initial environment setup
- **`test.sh`** - Run tests (called from Makefile)
- **`lint.sh`** - Run linter (called from Makefile)
- **`check.sh`** - Full check (called from Makefile)

### Utilities:
- **`install-golangci-lint.sh`** - golangci-lint installation
- **`pre-commit`** - Git pre-commit hook

## What Changed:

### âœ… Removed:
- **`fix-deps.sh`** â†’ replaced by `make deps` and `make deps-clean`

### âœ… Optimized:
- **VS Code tasks** now use `make` commands
- **Makefile** became the main interface for developers
- **Scripts** preserved for Docker and automation

## Recommended Workflow:

### For Developers:
```bash
make install-tools  # once
make deps          # when dependencies change
make pre-commit    # before each commit
```

### For Deployment:
```bash
./scripts/start.sh    # start services
./scripts/setup.sh    # setup environment
./scripts/stop.sh     # stop services
```

The structure is now more logical: Makefile for development, scripts for automation! ðŸŽ¯
