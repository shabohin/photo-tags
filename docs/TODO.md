## 🎯 Priority Tasks for Next Iteration

### 🔥 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Analyzer Service** - Implement complete analysis logic
   - OpenRouter API integration
   - RabbitMQ consumers/publishers
   - Image processing
   
2. **Processor Service** - Full implementation from scratch
   - Architecture and structure
   - ExifTool integration
   - Metadata embedding in images

3. **Basic Unit tests** for critical components

### ⚡ HIGH PRIORITY (2-4 weeks)
4. **Integration tests** for all services
5. **End-to-end testing** of complete workflow
6. **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing

### 📈 MEDIUM PRIORITY (1-2 months)
8. **Performance testing** and optimization
9. **Monitoring and metrics**
10. **Production deployment** documentation

---

## 🚀 Launch Readiness

### What works now:
- ✅ Gateway Service (complete)
- ✅ RabbitMQ and MinIO infrastructure
- ✅ Docker environment

### What blocks launch:
- ❌ Analyzer Service (not implemented)
- ❌ Processor Service (not implemented)
- ❌ Lack of tests

### Time estimate to MVP:
**4-6 weeks** with active development

---

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Immediately**: Implement Analyzer Service
2. **This week**: Implement Processor Service  
3. **Next week**: Write basic tests
4. **In 2 weeks**: Integration testing
5. **In a month**: Production deployment preparation

## 📊 Detailed Component Breakdown

### Gateway Service: 95% ✅
- Fully implemented, ready for production use
- Only requires final integration tests

### Analyzer Service: 20% ⚠️
- Skeleton ready, main logic missing
- Critical component for system operation

### Processor Service: 5% ❌
- Only stub exists, requires full implementation
- Critical component for system operation

### Infrastructure: 90% ✅
- Docker, RabbitMQ, MinIO configured
- Requires monitoring and CI/CD
